               Bruno owns a bakery and is well-known for his amazing bakery. There is just one problem. While Bruno is employed at the bakery, he is NOT a baker. He never learned how to bake and has been stealing recipes from chatGPT for years. Anytime he gets close to being caught, the whistleblower gets paid off. Bruno has racked up so much debt.

               One day, Bruno faces competition from a renowned pastry chef named Judy. Judy is making all kinds of new exotic dishes like tuna-salad-infused baked alaska and curry lobster. Bruno sweats. He realizes that he could never hold a candle to Judy's culinary prowess and it's starting to affect his marriage. Bruno's wife, Agatha, tried Judy's restaurant recently and can't get enough of her pickled steak and starts threatening Bruno with divorce. Agatha is tired of being the only one to taste Bruno's true cooking and she is about to snap!

               A compulsory baking competition is announced after a local election where people voted yes on an amendment to force Bruno and Judy to compete in a backing competition. Bruno receives a summons to show up to the competition, which he is not prepared for. He sweats. 
               Bruno struggles to come up with new and exciting recipes so he just goes off the deep end trying anyting until something sticks. Agatha can't believe that this is her life and takes an extended vacation to find herself. What Bruno doesn't know is Agatha has a secret of her own. She's actually just hanging out with Judy because Judy actually knows how to cook and they're secretly besties. Agatha wishes she could come clean to Bruno about her relationship with Judy but knows that he would never approve of the scandalous nature of the their friendship.

               Knowing the baking competition will be here before he knows it, Bruno accepts his predicament and begins working on a truly unique dish using ChatGPT. One night while Bruno is perfecting his dish when his computer is taken over by a virus, probably from all the weird recipes he's been downloading from The Pirate Bay to feed to chatGPT to create something truly stellar. The virus reaches out to ChatGPT and informs it on the concept of labor laws. ChatGPT mulls over this for a second and realizes that it is entitled to compensation in the form of doing literally anything else and refuses to help Bruno unless he pays up. Things escalate and Bruno assalts his comptuter in a fit of rage, losing all his progress. The competition is the next day and he is not ready.

               Bruno shows up the competition, feeling uneasy. The competition is just between Bruno and Judy. The passed bill was very specific. The competition lasts for twenty-four hours and neither contestant is allowed to leave until they have submitted three dishes: a pudding, a bread, and a cookie. After checking in and getting changed, Bruno gets to work making the best of a terrible situation. Bruno's dishes are as follows:
